And as for going as cook,—though\n      I confess there is considerable glory in that, a cook being a sort of\n      officer on ship-board—yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls;—though\n      once broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered,\n      there is no one who will speak more respectfully, not to say\n      reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will.

His face was deeply brown and burnt, making his\n      white teeth dazzling by the contrast; while in the deep shadows of his\n      eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy.\n      His voice at once announced that he was a Southerner, and from his fine\n      stature, I thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the\n      Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia.

Holding a light in one hand, and that identical New\n      Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and without\n      looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off from me on the\n      floor in one corner, and then began working away at the knotted cords of\n      the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room. I was all eagerness\n      to see his face, but he kept it averted for some time while employed in\n      unlacing the bag’s mouth. This accomplished, however, he turned round—when,\n      good heavens! what a sight! Such a face! It was of a dark, purplish,\n      yellow colour, here and there stuck over with large blackish looking\n      squares. Yes, it’s just as I thought, he’s a terrible bedfellow; he’s been\n      in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here he is, just from the surgeon. But\n      at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light, that I\n      plainly saw they could not be sticking-plasters at all, those black\n      squares on his cheeks. They were stains of some sort or other. At first I\n      knew not what to make of this; but soon an inkling of the truth occurred\n      to me. I remembered a story of a white man—a whaleman too—who,\n      falling among the cannibals, had been tattooed by them. I concluded that\n      this harpooneer, in the course of his distant voyages, must have met with\n      a similar adventure. And what is it, thought I, after all! It’s only his\n      outside; a man can be honest in any sort of skin. But then, what to make\n      of his unearthly complexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about,\n      and completely independent of the squares of tattooing. To be sure, it\n      might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never heard of\n      a hot sun’s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one. However, I had\n      never been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun there produced these\n      extraordinary effects upon the skin. Now, while all these ideas were\n      passing through me like lightning, this harpooneer never noticed me at\n      all. But, after some difficulty having opened his bag, he commenced\n      fumbling in it, and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a\n      seal-skin wallet with the hair on. Placing these on the old chest in the\n      middle of the room, he then took the New Zealand head—a ghastly\n      thing enough—and crammed it down into the bag. He now took off his\n      hat—a new beaver hat—when I came nigh singing out with fresh\n      surprise. There was no hair on his head—none to speak of at least—nothing\n      but a small scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead. His bald purplish head\n      now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull. Had not the stranger\n      stood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker than\n      ever I bolted a dinner."

Sixteen hours in bed! the small of\n      my back ached to think of it. And it was so light too; the sun shining in\n      at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in the streets, and the\n      sound of gay voices all over the house. I felt worse and worse—at\n      last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in my stockinged feet,\n      sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw myself at her feet,\n      beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good slippering for my\n      misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning me to lie abed such an\n      unendurable length of time. But she was the best and most conscientious of\n      stepmothers, and back I had to go to my room. For several hours I lay\n      there broad awake, feeling a great deal worse than I have ever done since,\n      even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes.

Instantly I felt a shock running through\n      all my frame; nothing was to be seen, and nothing was to be heard; but a\n      supernatural hand seemed placed in mine. My arm hung over the counterpane,\n      and the nameless, unimaginable, silent form or phantom, to which the hand\n      belonged, seemed closely seated by my bed-side. For what seemed ages piled\n      on ages, I lay there, frozen with the most awful fears, not daring to drag\n      away my hand; yet ever thinking that if I could but stir it one single\n      inch, the horrid spell would be broken.

But at length all the past night’s events soberly\n      recurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only alive to the\n      comical predicament. For though I tried to move his arm—unlock his\n      bridegroom clasp—yet, sleeping as he was, he still hugged me\n      tightly, as though naught but death should part us twain. I now strove to\n      rouse him—“Queequeg!”—but his only answer was a snore. I then\n      rolled over, my neck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar; and suddenly\n      felt a slight scratch. Throwing aside the counterpane, there lay the\n      tomahawk sleeping by the savage’s side, as if it were a hatchet-faced\n      baby. A pretty pickle, truly, thought I; abed here in a strange house in\n      the broad day, with a cannibal and a tomahawk! “Queequeg!—in the\n      name of goodness, Queequeg, wake!” At length, by dint of much wriggling,\n      and loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his\n      hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in\n      extracting a grunt; and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself all\n      over like a Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in bed, stiff\n      as a pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if he did not\n      altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim consciousness of\n      knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over him. Meanwhile, I\n      lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious misgivings now, and bent upon\n      narrowly observing so curious a creature. When, at last, his mind seemed\n      made up touching the character of his bedfellow, and he became, as it\n      were, reconciled to the fact; he jumped out upon the floor, and by certain\n      signs and sounds gave me to understand that, if it pleased me, he would\n      dress first and then leave me to dress afterwards, leaving the whole\n      apartment to myself. Thinks I, Queequeg, under the circumstances, this is\n      a very civilized overture; but, the truth is, these savages have an innate\n      sense of delicacy, say what you will; it is marvellous how essentially\n      polite they are. I pay this particular compliment to Queequeg, because he\n      treated me with so much civility and consideration, while I was guilty of\n      great rudeness; staring at him from the bed, and watching all his toilette\n      motions; for the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding.\n      Nevertheless, a man like Queequeg you don’t see every day, he and his ways\n      were well worth unusual regarding."

No one having previously heard his\n      history, could for the first time behold Father Mapple without the utmost\n      interest, because there were certain engrafted clerical peculiarities\n      about him, imputable to that adventurous maritime life he had led.

He skulks about the wharves of Joppa, and seeks a ship that’s bound\n      for Tarshish. There lurks, perhaps, a hitherto unheeded meaning here. By\n      all accounts Tarshish could have been no other city than the modern Cadiz.\n      That’s the opinion of learned men. And where is Cadiz, shipmates? Cadiz is\n      in Spain; as far by water, from Joppa, as Jonah could possibly have sailed\n      in those ancient days, when the Atlantic was an almost unknown sea.\n      Because Joppa, the modern Jaffa, shipmates, is on the most easterly coast\n      of the Mediterranean, the Syrian; and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two\n      thousand miles to the westward from that, just outside the Straits of\n      Gibraltar. See ye not then, shipmates, that Jonah sought to flee\n      world-wide from God? Miserable man! Oh! most contemptible and worthy of\n      all scorn; with slouched hat and guilty eye, skulking from his God;\n      prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the\n      seas. So disordered, self-condemning is his look, that had there been\n      policemen in those days, Jonah, on the mere suspicion of something wrong,\n      had been arrested ere he touched a deck. How plainly he’s a fugitive! no\n      baggage, not a hat-box, valise, or carpet-bag,—no friends accompany\n      him to the wharf with their adieux. At last, after much dodging search, he\n      finds the Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo; and as he\n      steps on board to see its Captain in the cabin, all the sailors for the\n      moment desist from hoisting in the goods, to mark the stranger’s evil eye.\n      Jonah sees this; but in vain he tries to look all ease and confidence; in\n      vain essays his wretched smile. Strong intuitions of the man assure the\n      mariners he can be no innocent. In their gamesome but still serious way,\n      one whispers to the other—“Jack, he’s robbed a widow;” or, “Joe, do\n      you mark him; he’s a bigamist;” or, “Harry lad, I guess he’s the adulterer\n      that broke jail in old Gomorrah, or belike, one of the missing murderers\n      from Sodom.” Another runs to read the bill that’s stuck against the spile\n      upon the wharf to which the ship is moored, offering five hundred gold\n      coins for the apprehension of a parricide, and containing a description of\n      his person. He reads, and looks from Jonah to the bill; while all his\n      sympathetic shipmates now crowd round Jonah, prepared to lay their hands\n      upon him. Frighted Jonah trembles, and summoning all his boldness to his\n      face, only looks so much the more a coward. He will not confess himself\n      suspected; but that itself is strong suspicion.

Wave after wave thus leaps into the ship, and finding no speedy\n      vent runs roaring fore and aft, till the mariners come nigh to drowning\n      while yet afloat. And ever, as the white moon shows her affrighted face\n      from the steep gullies in the blackness overhead, aghast Jonah sees the\n      rearing bowsprit pointing high upward, but soon beat downward again\n      towards the tormented deep."

Then God\n      spake unto the fish; and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the\n      sea, the whale came breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun, and\n      all the delights of air and earth; and ‘vomited out Jonah upon the dry\n      land;’ when the word of the Lord came a second time; and Jonah, bruised\n      and beaten—his ears, like two sea-shells, still multitudinously\n      murmuring of the ocean—Jonah did the Almighty’s bidding.

Hiding\n      his canoe, still afloat, among these thickets, with its prow seaward, he\n      sat down in the stern, paddle low in hand; and when the ship was gliding\n      by, like a flash he darted out; gained her side; with one backward dash of\n      his foot capsized and sank his canoe; climbed up the chains; and throwing\n      himself at full length upon the deck, grappled a ring-bolt there, and\n      swore not to let it go, though hacked in pieces."

Nothing was done, and nothing seemed capable of being done;\n      those on deck rushed towards the bows, and stood eyeing the boom as if it\n      were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale. In the midst of this\n      consternation, Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and crawling under\n      the path of the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured one end to the\n      bulwarks, and then flinging the other like a lasso, caught it round the\n      boom as it swept over his head, and at the next jerk, the spar was that\n      way trapped, and all was safe. The schooner was run into the wind, and\n      while the hands were clearing away the stern boat, Queequeg, stripped to\n      the waist, darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap.

She was a ship of the old school, rather small if\n      anything; with an old-fashioned claw-footed look about her. Long seasoned\n      and weather-stained in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans, her old\n      hull’s complexion was darkened like a French grenadier’s, who has alike\n      fought in Egypt and Siberia.

Her masts—cut\n      somewhere on the coast of Japan, where her original ones were lost\n      overboard in a gale—her masts stood stiffly up like the spines of\n      the three old kings of Cologne. Her ancient decks were worn and wrinkled,\n      like the pilgrim-worshipped flag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where\n      Becket bled. But to all these her old antiquities, were added new and\n      marvellous features, pertaining to the wild business that for more than\n      half a century she had followed. Old Captain Peleg, many years her\n      chief-mate, before he commanded another vessel of his own, and now a\n      retired seaman, and one of the principal owners of the Pequod,—this\n      old Peleg, during the term of his chief-mateship, had built upon her\n      original grotesqueness, and inlaid it, all over, with a quaintness both of\n      material and device, unmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake’s\n      carved buckler or bedstead. She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian\n      emperor, his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory. She was a thing\n      of trophies. A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased\n      bones of her enemies. All round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were\n      garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the sperm\n      whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons\n      to. Those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood, but deftly\n      travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile wheel at her\n      reverend helm, she sported there a tiller; and that tiller was in one\n      mass, curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary\n      foe. The helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest, felt like the\n      Tartar, when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw. A noble\n      craft, but somehow a most melancholy!

I began to think it was high time to settle with myself at\n      what terms I would be willing to engage for the voyage. I was already\n      aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages; but all hands,\n      including the captain, received certain shares of the profits called lays,\n      and that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance\n      pertaining to the respective duties of the ship’s company. I was also\n      aware that being a green hand at whaling, my own lay would not be very\n      large; but considering that I was used to the sea, could steer a ship,\n      splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt that from all I had heard I\n      should be offered at least the 275th lay—that is, the 275th part of\n      the clear net proceeds of the voyage, whatever that might eventually\n      amount to. And though the 275th lay was what they call a rather long lay,\n      yet it was better than nothing; and if we had a lucky voyage, might pretty\n      nearly pay for the clothing I would wear out on it, not to speak of my\n      three years’ beef and board, for which I would not have to pay one stiver."

One way and\n      another, it has begotten events so remarkable in themselves, and so\n      continuously momentous in their sequential issues, that whaling may well\n      be regarded as that Egyptian mother, who bore offspring themselves\n      pregnant from her womb. It would be a hopeless, endless task to catalogue\n      all these things. Let a handful suffice. For many years past the\n      whale-ship has been the pioneer in ferreting out the remotest and least\n      known parts of the earth. She has explored seas and archipelagoes which\n      had no chart, where no Cook or Vancouver had ever sailed.

For in their succourless empty-handedness, they, in\n      the heathenish sharked waters, and by the beaches of unrecorded, javelin\n      islands, battled with virgin wonders and terrors that Cook with all his\n      marines and muskets would not willingly have dared.

He was a long, earnest man, and though born on an icy\n      coast, seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh being hard\n      as twice-baked biscuit. Transported to the Indies, his live blood would\n      not spoil like bottled ale. He must have been born in some time of general\n      drought and famine, or upon one of those fast days for which his state is\n      famous. Only some thirty arid summers had he seen; those summers had dried\n      up all his physical superfluousness. But this, his thinness, so to speak,\n      seemed no more the token of wasting anxieties and cares, than it seemed\n      the indication of any bodily blight. It was merely the condensation of the\n      man. He was by no means ill-looking; quite the contrary. His pure tight\n      skin was an excellent fit; and closely wrapped up in it, and embalmed with\n      inner health and strength, like a revivified Egyptian, this Starbuck\n      seemed prepared to endure for long ages to come, and to endure always, as\n      now; for be it Polar snow or torrid sun, like a patent chronometer, his\n      interior vitality was warranted to do well in all climates. Looking into\n      his eyes, you seemed to see there the yet lingering images of those\n      thousand-fold perils he had calmly confronted through life. A staid,\n      steadfast man, whose life for the most part was a telling pantomime of\n      action, and not a tame chapter of sounds. Yet, for all his hardy sobriety\n      and fortitude, there were certain qualities in him which at times\n      affected, and in some cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest.\n      Uncommonly conscientious for a seaman, and endued with a deep natural\n      reverence, the wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly\n      incline him to superstition; but to that sort of superstition, which in\n      some organizations seems rather to spring, somehow, from intelligence than\n      from ignorance. Outward portents and inward presentiments were his. And if\n      at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul, much more did his\n      far-away domestic memories of his young Cape wife and child, tend to bend\n      him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature, and open him\n      still further to those latent influences which, in some honest-hearted\n      men, restrain the gush of dare-devil daring, so often evinced by others in\n      the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. “I will have no man in my\n      boat,” said Starbuck, “who is not afraid of a whale.” By this, he seemed\n      to mean, not only that the most reliable and useful courage was that which\n      arises from the fair estimation of the encountered peril, but that an\n      utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward."

In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler,\n      lying in a lonely bay on his native coast. And never having been anywhere\n      in the world but in Africa, Nantucket, and the pagan harbors most\n      frequented by whalemen; and having now led for many years the bold life of\n      the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what manner of\n      men they shipped; Daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues, and erect as a\n      giraffe, moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in his\n      socks. There was a corporeal humility in looking up at him; and a white\n      man standing before him seemed a white flag come to beg truce of a\n      fortress. Curious to tell, this imperial negro, Ahasuerus Daggoo, was the\n      Squire of little Flask, who looked like a chess-man beside him. As for the\n      residue of the Pequod’s company, be it said, that at the present day not\n      one in two of the many thousand men before the mast employed in the\n      American whale fishery, are Americans born, though pretty nearly all the\n      officers are. Herein it is the same with the American whale fishery as\n      with the American army and military and merchant navies, and the\n      engineering forces employed in the construction of the American Canals and\n      Railroads. The same, I say, because in all these cases the native American\n      liberally provides the brains, the rest of the world as generously\n      supplying the muscles. No small number of these whaling seamen belong to\n      the Azores, where the outward bound Nantucket whalers frequently touch to\n      augment their crews from the hardy peasants of those rocky shores.

Upon the\n      passage homewards, they drop them there again. How it is, there is no\n      telling, but Islanders seem to make the best whalemen. They were nearly\n      all Islanders in the Pequod, Isolatoes too, I call such, not acknowledging\n      the common continent of men, but each Isolato living on a separate\n      continent of his own. Yet now, federated along one keel, what a set these\n      Isolatoes were! An Anacharsis Clootz deputation from all the isles of the\n      sea, and all the ends of the earth, accompanying Old Ahab in the Pequod to\n      lay the world’s grievances before that bar from which not very many of\n      them ever come back.

Threading its way out from\n      among his grey hairs, and continuing right down one side of his tawny\n      scorched face and neck, till it disappeared in his clothing, you saw a\n      slender rod-like mark, lividly whitish.

But once, the mood was on him\n      too deep for common regardings; and as with heavy, lumber-like pace he was\n      measuring the ship from taffrail to mainmast, Stubb, the old second mate,\n      came up from below, with a certain unassured, deprecating humorousness,\n      hinted that if Captain Ahab was pleased to walk the planks, then, no one\n      could say nay; but there might be some way of muffling the noise; hinting\n      something indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow, and the\n      insertion into it, of the ivory heel.

It’s queer; very queer; and he’s queer too; aye, take him\n      fore and aft, he’s about the queerest old man Stubb ever sailed with. How\n      he flashed at me!—his eyes like powder-pans! is he mad? Anyway\n      there’s something on his mind, as sure as there must be something on a\n      deck when it cracks. He aint in his bed now, either, more than three hours\n      out of the twenty-four; and he don’t sleep then. Didn’t that Dough-Boy,\n      the steward, tell me that of a morning he always finds the old man’s\n      hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled, and the sheets down at the foot,\n      and the coverlid almost tied into knots, and the pillow a sort of\n      frightful hot, as though a baked brick had been on it? A hot old man! I\n      guess he’s got what some folks ashore call a conscience; it’s a kind of\n      Tic-Dolly-row they say—worse nor a toothache. Well, well; I don’t\n      know what it is, but the Lord keep me from catching it. He’s full of\n      riddles; I wonder what he goes into the after hold for, every night, as\n      Dough-Boy tells me he suspects; what’s that for, I should like to know?\n      Who’s made appointments with him in the hold? Ain’t that queer, now? But\n      there’s no telling, it’s the old game—Here goes for a snooze. Damn\n      me, it’s worth a fellow’s while to be born into the world, if only to fall\n      right asleep. And now that I think of it, that’s about the first thing\n      babies do, and that’s a sort of queer, too. Damn me, but all things are\n      queer, come to think of ’em. But that’s against my principles. Think not,\n      is my eleventh commandment; and sleep when you can, is my twelfth—So\n      here goes again. But how’s that? didn’t he call me a dog? blazes! he\n      called me ten times a donkey, and piled a lot of jackasses on top of that!\n      He might as well have kicked me, and done with it. Maybe he did kick me,\n      and I didn’t observe it, I was so taken all aback with his brow, somehow.\n      It flashed like a bleached bone. What the devil’s the matter with me? I\n      don’t stand right on my legs. Coming afoul of that old man has a sort of\n      turned me wrong side out. By the Lord, I must have been dreaming, though—How?\n      how? how?—but the only way’s to stash it; so here goes to hammock\n      again; and in the morning, I’ll see how this plaguey juggling thinks over\n      by daylight.”"

    "content": "“Such a queer dream, King-Post, I never had. You know the old man’s ivory\n      leg, well I dreamed he kicked me with it; and when I tried to kick back,\n      upon my soul, my little man, I kicked my leg right off! And then, presto!\n      Ahab seemed a pyramid, and I, like a blazing fool, kept kicking at it. But\n      what was still more curious, Flask—you know how curious all dreams\n      are—through all this rage that I was in, I somehow seemed to be\n      thinking to myself, that after all, it was not much of an insult, that\n      kick from Ahab. ‘Why,’ thinks I, ‘what’s the row? It’s not a real leg,\n      only a false leg.’ And there’s a mighty difference between a living thump\n      and a dead thump. That’s what makes a blow from the hand, Flask, fifty\n      times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane. The living member—that\n      makes the living insult, my little man. And thinks I to myself all the\n      while, mind, while I was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed\n      pyramid—so confoundedly contradictory was it all, all the while, I\n      say, I was thinking to myself, ‘what’s his leg now, but a cane—a\n      whalebone cane. Yes,’ thinks I, ‘it was only a playful cudgelling—in\n      fact, only a whaleboning that he gave me—not a base kick. Besides,’ \n      thinks I, ‘look at it once; why, the end of it—the foot part—what\n      a small sort of end it is; whereas, if a broad footed farmer kicked me,\n      there’s a devilish broad insult. But this insult is whittled down to a\n      point only.’ But now comes the greatest joke of the dream, Flask. While I\n      was battering away at the pyramid, a sort of badger-haired old merman,\n      with a hump on his back, takes me by the shoulders, and slews me round.\n      ‘What are you ’bout?’ says he. Slid! man, but I was frightened. Such a\n      phiz! But, somehow, next moment I was over the fright. ‘What am I about?’ \n      says I at last. ‘And what business is that of yours, I should like to\n      know, Mr. Humpback? Do you want a kick?’ By the lord, Flask, I had no\n      sooner said that, than he turned round his stern to me, bent over, and\n      dragging up a lot of seaweed he had for a clout—what do you think, I\n      saw?—why thunder alive, man, his stern was stuck full of\n      marlinspikes, with the points out. Says I, on second thoughts, ‘I guess I\n      won’t kick you, old fellow.’ ‘Wise Stubb,’ said he, ‘wise Stubb;’ and kept\n      muttering it all the time, a sort of eating of his own gums like a chimney\n      hag. Seeing he wasn’t going to stop saying over his ‘wise Stubb, wise\n      Stubb,’ I thought I might as well fall to kicking the pyramid again. But I\n      had only just lifted my foot for it, when he roared out, ‘Stop that\n      kicking!’ ‘Halloa,’ says I, ‘what’s the matter now, old fellow?’ ‘Look ye\n      here,’ says he; ‘let’s argue the insult. Captain Ahab kicked ye, didn’t\n      he?’ ‘Yes, he did,’ says I—‘right here it was.’ ‘Very good,’ says he—‘he\n      used his ivory leg, didn’t he?’ ‘Yes, he did,’ says I. ‘Well then,’ says\n      he, ‘wise Stubb, what have you to complain of? Didn’t he kick with right\n      good will? it wasn’t a common pitch pine leg he kicked with, was it? No,\n      you were kicked by a great man, and with a beautiful ivory leg, Stubb.\n      It’s an honor; I consider it an honor. Listen, wise Stubb. In old\n      England the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen,\n      and made garter-knights of; but, be your boast, Stubb, that ye were kicked\n      by old Ahab, and made a wise man of. Remember what I say; be kicked by\n      him; account his kicks honors; and on no account kick back; for you can’t\n      help yourself, wise Stubb. Don’t you see that pyramid?’ With that, he all\n      of a sudden seemed somehow, in some queer fashion, to swim off into the\n      air. I snored; rolled over; and there I was in my hammock! Now, what do\n      you think of that dream, Flask?”"

All his peculiarities will,\n      in many other places, be enlarged upon. It is chiefly with his name that I\n      now have to do. Philologically considered, it is absurd. Some centuries\n      ago, when the Sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own proper\n      individuality, and when his oil was only accidentally obtained from the\n      stranded fish; in those days spermaceti, it would seem, was popularly\n      supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the one then known\n      in England as the Greenland or Right Whale. It was the idea also, that\n      this same spermaceti was that quickening humor of the Greenland Whale\n      which the first syllable of the word literally expresses. In those times,\n      also, spermaceti was exceedingly scarce, not being used for light, but\n      only as an ointment and medicament. It was only to be had from the\n      druggists as you nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb. When, as I opine, in\n      the course of time, the true nature of spermaceti became known, its\n      original name was still retained by the dealers; no doubt to enhance its\n      value by a notion so strangely significant of its scarcity. And so the\n      appellation must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from\n      which this spermaceti was really derived."

(Fin-Back).—Under this head I reckon a\n      monster which, by the various names of Fin-Back, Tall-Spout, and\n      Long-John, has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale\n      whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the\n      Atlantic, in the New York packet-tracks. In the length he attains, and in\n      his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the right whale, but is of a less\n      portly girth, and a lighter colour, approaching to olive. His great lips\n      present a cable-like aspect, formed by the intertwisting, slanting folds\n      of large wrinkles. His grand distinguishing feature, the fin, from which\n      he derives his name, is often a conspicuous object. This fin is some three\n      or four feet long, growing vertically from the hinder part of the back, of\n      an angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed end. Even if not the\n      slightest other part of the creature be visible, this isolated fin will,\n      at times, be seen plainly projecting from the surface. When the sea is\n      moderately calm, and slightly marked with spherical ripples, and this\n      gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled surface, it\n      may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it somewhat\n      resembles a dial, with its style and wavy hour-lines graved on it. On that\n      Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes back. The Fin-Back is not gregarious. He\n      seems a whale-hater, as some men are man-haters. Very shy; always going\n      solitary; unexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most\n      sullen waters; his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall\n      misanthropic spear upon a barren plain; gifted with such wondrous power\n      and velocity in swimming, as to defy all present pursuit from man; this\n      leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable Cain of his race, bearing\n      for his mark that style upon his back. From having the baleen in his\n      mouth, the Fin-Back is sometimes included with the right whale, among a\n      theoretic species denominated Whalebone whales, that is, whales with\n      baleen. Of these so called Whalebone whales, there would seem to be\n      several varieties, most of which, however, are little known. Broad-nosed\n      whales and beaked whales; pike-headed whales; bunched whales; under-jawed\n      whales and rostrated whales, are the fishermen’s names for a few sorts."

How then? The baleen, hump,\n      back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose peculiarities are\n      indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales, without any regard\n      to what may be the nature of their structure in other and more essential\n      particulars. Thus, the sperm whale and the humpbacked whale, each has a\n      hump; but there the similitude ceases. Then, this same humpbacked whale\n      and the Greenland whale, each of these has baleen; but there again the\n      similitude ceases.

(Narwhale), that is, Nostril whale.—Another\n      instance of a curiously named whale, so named I suppose from his peculiar\n      horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose. The creature is some\n      sixteen feet in length, while its horn averages five feet, though some\n      exceed ten, and even attain to fifteen feet. Strictly speaking, this horn\n      is but a lengthened tusk, growing out from the jaw in a line a little\n      depressed from the horizontal. But it is only found on the sinister side,\n      which has an ill effect, giving its owner something analogous to the\n      aspect of a clumsy left-handed man. What precise purpose this ivory horn\n      or lance answers, it would be hard to say. It does not seem to be used\n      like the blade of the sword-fish and bill-fish; though some sailors tell\n      me that the Narwhale employs it for a rake in turning over the bottom of\n      the sea for food. Charley Coffin said it was used for an ice-piercer; for\n      the Narwhale, rising to the surface of the Polar Sea, and finding it\n      sheeted with ice, thrusts his horn up, and so breaks through. But you\n      cannot prove either of these surmises to be correct. My own opinion is,\n      that however this one-sided horn may really be used by the Narwhale—however\n      that may be—it would certainly be very convenient to him for a\n      folder in reading pamphlets. The Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked\n      whale, the Horned whale, and the Unicorn whale. He is certainly a curious\n      example of the Unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated\n      nature. From certain cloistered old authors I have gathered that this same\n      sea-unicorn’s horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote\n      against poison, and as such, preparations of it brought immense prices. It\n      was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies, the same way\n      that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn.\n      Originally it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity. Black\n      Letter tells me that Sir Martin Frobisher on his return from that voyage,\n      when Queen Bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from a window\n      of Greenwich Palace, as his bold ship sailed down the Thames; “when Sir\n      Martin returned from that voyage,” saith Black Letter, “on bended knees he\n      presented to her highness a prodigious long horn of the Narwhale, which\n      for a long period after hung in the castle at Windsor.” An Irish author\n      avers that the Earl of Leicester, on bended knees, did likewise present to\n      her highness another horn, pertaining to a land beast of the unicorn\n      nature."

For though their\n      progenitors, the builders of Babel, must doubtless, by their tower, have\n      intended to rear the loftiest mast-head in all Asia, or Africa either; yet\n      (ere the final truck was put to it) as that great stone mast of theirs may\n      be said to have gone by the board, in the dread gale of God’s wrath;\n      therefore, we cannot give these Babel builders priority over the\n      Egyptians. And that the Egyptians were a nation of mast-head standers, is\n      an assertion based upon the general belief among archæologists, that the\n      first pyramids were founded for astronomical purposes: a theory singularly\n      supported by the peculiar stair-like formation of all four sides of those\n      edifices; whereby, with prodigious long upliftings of their legs, those\n      old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex, and sing out for new\n      stars; even as the look-outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail, or a\n      whale just bearing in sight. In Saint Stylites, the famous Christian\n      hermit of old times, who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and\n      spent the whole latter portion of his life on its summit, hoisting his\n      food from the ground with a tackle; in him we have a remarkable instance\n      of a dauntless stander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his\n      place by fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing\n      everything out to the last, literally died at his post. Of modern\n      standers-of-mast-heads we have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron, and\n      bronze men; who, though well capable of facing out a stiff gale, are still\n      entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon discovering any\n      strange sight. There is Napoleon; who, upon the top of the column of\n      Vendome, stands with arms folded, some one hundred and fifty feet in the\n      air; careless, now, who rules the decks below; whether Louis Philippe,\n      Louis Blanc, or Louis the Devil. Great Washington, too, stands high aloft\n      on his towering main-mast in Baltimore, and like one of Hercules’ pillars,\n      his column marks that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals\n      will go. Admiral Nelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal, stands his\n      mast-head in Trafalgar Square; and ever when most obscured by that London\n      smoke, token is yet given that a hidden hero is there; for where there is\n      smoke, must be fire. But neither great Washington, nor Napoleon, nor\n      Nelson, will answer a single hail from below, however madly invoked to\n      befriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze;\n      however it may be surmised, that their spirits penetrate through the thick\n      haze of the future, and descry what shoals and what rocks must be shunned."

The worthy Obed tells us, that in the early\n      times of the whale fishery, ere ships were regularly launched in pursuit\n      of the game, the people of that island erected lofty spars along the\n      sea-coast, to which the look-outs ascended by means of nailed cleats,\n      something as fowls go upstairs in a hen-house. A few years ago this same\n      plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of New Zealand, who, upon descrying\n      the game, gave notice to the ready-manned boats nigh the beach.

There you stand, lost in the infinite\n      series of the sea, with nothing ruffled but the waves. The tranced ship\n      indolently rolls; the drowsy trade winds blow; everything resolves you\n      into languor.

To be sure, in cold weather you may\n      carry your house aloft with you, in the shape of a watch-coat; but\n      properly speaking the thickest watch-coat is no more of a house than the\n      unclad body; for as the soul is glued inside of its fleshy tabernacle, and\n      cannot freely move about in it, nor even move out of it, without running\n      great risk of perishing (like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps\n      in winter); so a watch-coat is not so much of a house as it is a mere\n      envelope, or additional skin encasing you. You cannot put a shelf or chest\n      of drawers in your body, and no more can you make a convenient closet of\n      your watch-coat."

    "content": "Concerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of a\n      southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or\n      pulpits, called crow’s-nests, in which the look-outs of a Greenland whaler\n      are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas. In the\n      fireside narrative of Captain Sleet, entitled “A Voyage among the\n      Icebergs, in quest of the Greenland Whale, and incidentally for the\n      re-discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of Old Greenland;” in this\n      admirable volume, all standers of mast-heads are furnished with a\n      charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented\n      crow’s-nest of the Glacier, which was the name of Captain Sleet’s good\n      craft. He called it the Sleet’s crow’s-nest, in honor of himself; he\n      being the original inventor and patentee, and free from all ridiculous\n      false delicacy, and holding that if we call our own children after our own\n      names (we fathers being the original inventors and patentees), so likewise\n      should we denominate after ourselves any other apparatus we may beget. In\n      shape, the Sleet’s crow’s-nest is something like a large tierce or pipe;\n      it is open above, however, where it is furnished with a movable\n      side-screen to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale. Being fixed\n      on the summit of the mast, you ascend into it through a little trap-hatch\n      in the bottom. On the after side, or side next the stern of the ship, is a\n      comfortable seat, with a locker underneath for umbrellas, comforters, and\n      coats. In front is a leather rack, in which to keep your speaking trumpet,\n      pipe, telescope, and other nautical conveniences. When Captain Sleet in\n      person stood his mast-head in this crow’s-nest of his, he tells us that he\n      always had a rifle with him (also fixed in the rack), together with a\n      powder flask and shot, for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales,\n      or vagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters; for you cannot\n      successfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the\n      water, but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing. Now, it was\n      plainly a labor of love for Captain Sleet to describe, as he does, all the\n      little detailed conveniences of his crow’s-nest; but though he so enlarges\n      upon many of these, and though he treats us to a very scientific account\n      of his experiments in this crow’s-nest, with a small compass he kept there\n      for the purpose of counteracting the errors resulting from what is called\n      the “local attraction” of all binnacle magnets; an error ascribable to the\n      horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ship’s planks, and in the Glacier’s\n      case, perhaps, to there having been so many broken-down blacksmiths among\n      her crew; I say, that though the Captain is very discreet and scientific\n      here, yet, for all his learned “binnacle deviations,” “azimuth compass\n      observations,” and “approximate errors,” he knows very well, Captain\n      Sleet, that he was not so much immersed in those profound magnetic\n      meditations, as to fail being attracted occasionally towards that well\n      replenished little case-bottle, so nicely tucked in on one side of his\n      crow’s nest, within easy reach of his hand. Though, upon the whole, I\n      greatly admire and even love the brave, the honest, and learned Captain;\n      yet I take it very ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that\n      case-bottle, seeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have\n      been, while with mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the\n      mathematics aloft there in that bird’s nest within three or four perches\n      of the pole."

Yet, when by this\n      collision forced to turn towards home, and for long months of days and\n      weeks, Ahab and anguish lay stretched together in one hammock, rounding in\n      mid winter that dreary, howling Patagonian Cape; then it was, that his\n      torn body and gashed soul bled into one another; and so interfusing, made\n      him mad. That it was only then, on the homeward voyage, after the\n      encounter, that the final monomania seized him, seems all but certain from\n      the fact that, at intervals during the passage, he was a raving lunatic;\n      and, though unlimbed of a leg, yet such vital strength yet lurked in his\n      Egyptian chest, and was moreover intensified by his delirium, that his\n      mates were forced to lace him fast, even there, as he sailed, raving in\n      his hammock. In a strait-jacket, he swung to the mad rockings of the\n      gales.

That before living agent, now became the living instrument. If\n      such a furious trope may stand, his special lunacy stormed his general\n      sanity, and carried it, and turned all its concentred cannon upon its own\n      mad mark; so that far from having lost his strength, Ahab, to that one\n      end, did now possess a thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely\n      brought to bear upon any one reasonable object."

At intervals, it arched forth its vast\n      archangel wings, as if to embrace some holy ark. Wondrous flutterings and\n      throbbings shook it. Though bodily unharmed, it uttered cries, as some\n      king’s ghost in supernatural distress. Through its inexpressible, strange\n      eyes, methought I peeped to secrets which took hold of God. As Abraham\n      before the angels, I bowed myself; the white thing was so white, its wings\n      so wide, and in those for ever exiled waters, I had lost the miserable\n      warping memories of traditions and of towns. Long I gazed at that prodigy\n      of plumage. I cannot tell, can only hint, the things that darted through\n      me then. But at last I awoke; and turning, asked a sailor what bird was\n      this. A goney, he replied. Goney! never had heard that name before; is it\n      conceivable that this glorious thing is utterly unknown to men ashore!\n      never!

But not so in the reality, perhaps.\n      Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons for\n      particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude that the herds\n      which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year, say, will\n      turn out to be identically the same with those that were found there the\n      preceding season; though there are peculiar and unquestionable instances\n      where the contrary of this has proved true. In general, the same remark,\n      only within a less wide limit, applies to the solitaries and hermits among\n      the matured, aged sperm whales. So that though Moby Dick had in a former\n      year been seen, for example, on what is called the Seychelle ground in the\n      Indian ocean, or Volcano Bay on the Japanese Coast; yet it did not follow,\n      that were the Pequod to visit either of those spots at any subsequent\n      corresponding season, she would infallibly encounter him there. So, too,\n      with some other feeding grounds, where he had at times revealed himself.\n      But all these seemed only his casual stopping-places and ocean-inns, so to\n      speak, not his places of prolonged abode. And where Ahab’s chances of\n      accomplishing his object have hitherto been spoken of, allusion has only\n      been made to whatever way-side, antecedent, extra prospects were his, ere\n      a particular set time or place were attained, when all possibilities would\n      become probabilities, and, as Ahab fondly thought, every possibility the\n      next thing to a certainty. That particular set time and place were\n      conjoined in the one technical phrase—the Season-on-the-Line. For\n      there and then, for several consecutive years, Moby Dick had been\n      periodically descried, lingering in those waters for awhile, as the sun,\n      in its annual round, loiters for a predicted interval in any one sign of\n      the Zodiac. There it was, too, that most of the deadly encounters with the\n      white whale had taken place; there the waves were storied with his deeds;\n      there also was that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man had found the\n      awful motive to his vengeance. But in the cautious comprehensiveness and\n      unloitering vigilance with which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this\n      unfaltering hunt, he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon\n      the one crowning fact above mentioned, however flattering it might be to\n      those hopes; nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize\n      his unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest."

Yet these, perhaps, instead\n      of being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness, or fright at\n      his own resolve, were but the plainest tokens of its intensity. For, at\n      such times, crazy Ahab, the scheming, unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the\n      white whale; this Ahab that had gone to his hammock, was not the agent\n      that so caused him to burst from it in horror again. The latter was the\n      eternal, living principle or soul in him; and in sleep, being for the time\n      dissociated from the characterizing mind, which at other times employed it\n      for its outer vehicle or agent, it spontaneously sought escape from the\n      scorching contiguity of the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it was\n      no longer an integral. But as the mind does not exist unless leagued with\n      the soul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahab’s case, yielding up\n      all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose; that purpose, by\n      its own sheer inveteracy of will, forced itself against gods and devils\n      into a kind of self-assumed, independent being of its own.

God help thee, old\n      man, thy thoughts have created a creature in thee; and he whose intense\n      thinking thus makes him a Prometheus; a vulture feeds upon that heart for\n      ever; that vulture the very creature he creates."

In the instance where three years\n      intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons; and I think it may\n      have been something more than that; the man who darted them happening, in\n      the interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage to Africa, went ashore\n      there, joined a discovery party, and penetrated far into the interior,\n      where he travelled for a period of nearly two years, often endangered by\n      serpents, savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas, with all the other common\n      perils incident to wandering in the heart of unknown regions. Meanwhile,\n      the whale he had struck must also have been on its travels; no doubt it\n      had thrice circumnavigated the globe, brushing with its flanks all the\n      coasts of Africa; but to no purpose. This man and this whale again came\n      together, and the one vanquished the other. I say I, myself, have known\n      three instances similar to this; that is in two of them I saw the whales\n      struck; and, upon the second attack, saw the two irons with the respective\n      marks cut in them, afterwards taken from the dead fish. In the three-year\n      instance, it so fell out that I was in the boat both times, first and\n      last, and the last time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole\n      under the whale’s eye, which I had observed there three years previous. I\n      say three years, but I am pretty sure it was more than that.

Conversation turning upon whales, the\n      Commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength\n      ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present. He peremptorily\n      denied for example, that any whale could so smite his stout sloop-of-war\n      as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful. Very good; but there is\n      more coming. Some weeks after, the Commodore set sail in this impregnable\n      craft for Valparaiso. But he was stopped on the way by a portly sperm\n      whale, that begged a few moments’ confidential business with him. That\n      business consisted in fetching the Commodore’s craft such a thwack, that\n      with all his pumps going he made straight for the nearest port to heave\n      down and repair. I am not superstitious, but I consider the Commodore’s\n      interview with that whale as providential. Was not Saul of Tarsus\n      converted from unbelief by a similar fright? I tell you, the sperm whale\n      will stand no nonsense."

And, indeed, the shock\n      was so sudden and violent, that we took it for granted the ship had struck\n      against a rock; but when the amazement was a little over, we cast the\n      lead, and sounded, but found no ground. * * * * * The suddenness of the shock\n      made the guns leap in their carriages, and several of the men were shaken\n      out of their hammocks. Captain Davis, who lay with his head on a gun, was\n      thrown out of his cabin!” Lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an\n      earthquake, and seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that a\n      great earthquake, somewhere about that time, did actually do great\n      mischief along the Spanish land.

In more\n      than one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the assailing\n      boats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself, and long\n      withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks. The English ship\n      Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head; and, as for his strength, let me\n      say, that there have been examples where the lines attached to a running\n      sperm whale have, in a calm, been transferred to the ship, and secured\n      there; the whale towing her great hull through the water, as a horse walks\n      off with a cart. Again, it is very often observed that, if the sperm\n      whale, once struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts, not so often\n      with blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of destruction to his\n      pursuers; nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his\n      character, that upon being attacked he will frequently open his mouth, and\n      retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive minutes. But I\n      must be content with only one more and a concluding illustration; a\n      remarkable and most significant one, by which you will not fail to see,\n      that not only is the most marvellous event in this book corroborated by\n      plain facts of the present day, but that these marvels (like all marvels)\n      are mere repetitions of the ages; so that for the millionth time we say\n      amen with Solomon—Verily there is nothing new under the sun."

For a long time I fancied that the\n      sperm whale had been always unknown in the Mediterranean and the deep\n      waters connecting with it. Even now I am certain that those seas are not,\n      and perhaps never can be, in the present constitution of things, a place\n      for his habitual gregarious resort. But further investigations have\n      recently proved to me, that in modern times there have been isolated\n      instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the Mediterranean. I am\n      told, on good authority, that on the Barbary coast, a Commodore Davis of\n      the British navy found the skeleton of a sperm whale.

Therefore he had not solicited a boat’s crew from them, nor had he\n      in any way hinted his desires on that head. Nevertheless he had taken\n      private measures of his own touching all that matter. Until Cabaco’s\n      published discovery, the sailors had little foreseen it, though to be sure\n      when, after being a little while out of port, all hands had concluded the\n      customary business of fitting the whaleboats for service; when some time\n      after this Ahab was now and then found bestirring himself in the matter of\n      making thole-pins with his own hands for what was thought to be one of the\n      spare boats, and even solicitously cutting the small wooden skewers, which\n      when the line is running out are pinned over the groove in the bow: when\n      all this was observed in him, and particularly his solicitude in having an\n      extra coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat, as if to make it better\n      withstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb; and also the anxiety he\n      evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board, or clumsy cleat, as it is\n      sometimes called, the horizontal piece in the boat’s bow for bracing the\n      knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale; when it was observed how\n      often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee fixed in the\n      semi-circular depression in the cleat, and with the carpenter’s chisel\n      gouged out a little here and straightened it a little there; all these\n      things, I say, had awakened much interest and curiosity at the time. But\n      almost everybody supposed that this particular preparative heedfulness in\n      Ahab must only be with a view to the ultimate chase of Moby Dick; for he\n      had already revealed his intention to hunt that mortal monster in person.\n      But such a supposition did by no means involve the remotest suspicion as\n      to any boat’s crew being assigned to that boat."

    "content": "There is another little item about Gamming which must not be forgotten\n      here. All professions have their own little peculiarities of detail; so\n      has the whale fishery. In a pirate, man-of-war, or slave ship, when the\n      captain is rowed anywhere in his boat, he always sits in the stern sheets\n      on a comfortable, sometimes cushioned seat there, and often steers himself\n      with a pretty little milliner’s tiller decorated with gay cords and\n      ribbons. But the whale-boat has no seat astern, no sofa of that sort\n      whatever, and no tiller at all. High times indeed, if whaling captains\n      were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty old aldermen in patent\n      chairs. And as for a tiller, the whale-boat never admits of any such\n      effeminacy; and therefore as in gamming a complete boat’s crew must leave\n      the ship, and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of the number,\n      that subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion, and the captain,\n      having no place to sit in, is pulled off to his visit all standing like a\n      pine tree. And often you will notice that being conscious of the eyes of\n      the whole visible world resting on him from the sides of the two ships,\n      this standing captain is all alive to the importance of sustaining his\n      dignity by maintaining his legs. Nor is this any very easy matter; for in\n      his rear is the immense projecting steering oar hitting him now and then\n      in the small of his back, the after-oar reciprocating by rapping his knees\n      in front. He is thus completely wedged before and behind, and can only\n      expand himself sideways by settling down on his stretched legs; but a\n      sudden, violent pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him, because\n      length of foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth. Merely make\n      a spread angle of two poles, and you cannot stand them up. Then, again, it\n      would never do in plain sight of the world’s riveted eyes, it would never\n      do, I say, for this straddling captain to be seen steadying himself the\n      slightest particle by catching hold of anything with his hands; indeed, as\n      token of his entire, buoyant self-command, he generally carries his hands\n      in his trowsers’ pockets; but perhaps being generally very large, heavy\n      hands, he carries them there for ballast. Nevertheless there have occurred\n      instances, well authenticated ones too, where the captain has been known\n      for an uncommonly critical moment or two, in a sudden squall say—to\n      seize hold of the nearest oarsman’s hair, and hold on there like grim\n      death."

Besides, it was the stronger men in the Town-Ho that\n      had been divided into gangs, taking turns at the pumps; and being the most\n      athletic seaman of them all, Steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain\n      of one of the gangs; consequently he should have been freed from any\n      trivial business not connected with truly nautical duties, such being the\n      case with his comrades.

But in order to insure the speediest\n      end to the voyage, they all agreed to another thing—namely, not to\n      sing out for whales, in case any should be discovered. For, spite of her\n      leak, and spite of all her other perils, the Town-Ho still maintained her\n      mast-heads, and her captain was just as willing to lower for a fish that\n      moment, as on the day his craft first struck the cruising ground; and\n      Radney the mate was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat, and\n      with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale."

All was now a phrensy. ‘The White Whale—the\n      White Whale!’ was the cry from captain, mates, and harpooneers, who,\n      undeterred by fearful rumours, were all anxious to capture so famous and\n      precious a fish; while the dogged crew eyed askance, and with curses, the\n      appalling beauty of the vast milky mass, that lit up by a horizontal\n      spangling sun, shifted and glistened like a living opal in the blue\n      morning sea. Gentlemen, a strange fatality pervades the whole career of\n      these events, as if verily mapped out before the world itself was charted.\n      The mutineer was the bowsman of the mate, and when fast to a fish, it was\n      his duty to sit next him, while Radney stood up with his lance in the\n      prow, and haul in or slacken the line, at the word of command. Moreover,\n      when the four boats were lowered, the mate’s got the start; and none\n      howled more fiercely with delight than did Steelkilt, as he strained at\n      his oar. After a stiff pull, their harpooneer got fast, and, spear in\n      hand, Radney sprang to the bow. He was always a furious man, it seems, in\n      a boat. And now his bandaged cry was, to beach him on the whale’s topmost\n      back. Nothing loath, his bowsman hauled him up and up, through a blinding\n      foam that blent two whitenesses together; till of a sudden the boat struck\n      as against a sunken ledge, and keeling over, spilled out the standing\n      mate. That instant, as he fell on the whale’s slippery back, the boat\n      righted, and was dashed aside by the swell, while Radney was tossed over\n      into the sea, on the other flank of the whale. He struck out through the\n      spray, and, for an instant, was dimly seen through that veil, wildly\n      seeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick. But the whale rushed\n      round in a sudden maelstrom; seized the swimmer between his jaws; and\n      rearing high up with him, plunged headlong again, and went down."

Most of the scientific drawings have been\n      taken from the stranded fish; and these are about as correct as a drawing\n      of a wrecked ship, with broken back, would correctly represent the noble\n      animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars. Though\n      elephants have stood for their full-lengths, the living Leviathan has\n      never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait. The living whale, in\n      his full majesty and significance, is only to be seen at sea in\n      unfathomable waters; and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight, like\n      a launched line-of-battle ship; and out of that element it is a thing\n      eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air, so\n      as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations. And, not to speak of\n      the highly presumable difference of contour between a young sucking whale\n      and a full-grown Platonian Leviathan; yet, even in the case of one of\n      those young sucking whales hoisted to a ship’s deck, such is then the\n      outlandish, eel-like, limbered, varying shape of him, that his precise\n      expression the devil himself could not catch."

For it\n      is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan, that his skeleton\n      gives very little idea of his general shape. Though Jeremy Bentham’s\n      skeleton, which hangs for candelabra in the library of one of his\n      executors, correctly conveys the idea of a burly-browed utilitarian old\n      gentleman, with all Jeremy’s other leading personal characteristics; yet\n      nothing of this kind could be inferred from any leviathan’s articulated\n      bones. In fact, as the great Hunter says, the mere skeleton of the whale\n      bears the same relation to the fully invested and padded animal as the\n      insect does to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it. This\n      peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head, as in some part of this\n      book will be incidentally shown. It is also very curiously displayed in\n      the side fin, the bones of which almost exactly answer to the bones of the\n      human hand, minus only the thumb. This fin has four regular bone-fingers,\n      the index, middle, ring, and little finger. But all these are permanently\n      lodged in their fleshy covering, as the human fingers in an artificial\n      covering. “However recklessly the whale may sometimes serve us,” said\n      humorous Stubb one day, “he can never be truly said to handle us without\n      mittens.”"

Respectively, they represent attacks on the\n      Sperm and Right Whale. In the first engraving a noble Sperm Whale is\n      depicted in full majesty of might, just risen beneath the boat from the\n      profundities of the ocean, and bearing high in the air upon his back the\n      terrific wreck of the stoven planks. The prow of the boat is partially\n      unbroken, and is drawn just balancing upon the monster’s spine; and\n      standing in that prow, for that one single incomputable flash of time, you\n      behold an oarsman, half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the\n      whale, and in the act of leaping, as if from a precipice. The action of\n      the whole thing is wonderfully good and true. The half-emptied line-tub\n      floats on the whitened sea; the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons\n      obliquely bob in it; the heads of the swimming crew are scattered about\n      the whale in contrasting expressions of affright; while in the black\n      stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene. Serious fault\n      might be found with the anatomical details of this whale, but let that\n      pass; since, for the life of me, I could not draw so good a one."

His\n      jets are erect, full, and black like soot; so that from so abounding a\n      smoke in the chimney, you would think there must be a brave supper cooking\n      in the great bowels below. Sea fowls are pecking at the small crabs,\n      shell-fish, and other sea candies and maccaroni, which the Right Whale\n      sometimes carries on his pestilent back. And all the while the\n      thick-lipped leviathan is rushing through the deep, leaving tons of\n      tumultuous white curds in his wake, and causing the slight boat to rock in\n      the swells like a skiff caught nigh the paddle-wheels of an ocean steamer.\n      Thus, the foreground is all raging commotion; but behind, in admirable\n      artistic contrast, is the glassy level of a sea becalmed, the drooping\n      unstarched sails of the powerless ship, and the inert mass of a dead\n      whale, a conquered fortress, with the flag of capture lazily hanging from\n      the whale-pole inserted into his spout-hole."

It is a quiet noon-scene\n      among the isles of the Pacific; a French whaler anchored, inshore, in a\n      calm, and lazily taking water on board; the loosened sails of the ship,\n      and the long leaves of the palms in the background, both drooping together\n      in the breezeless air.

The other engraving is quite a different\n      affair: the ship hove-to upon the open sea, and in the very heart of the\n      Leviathanic life, with a Right Whale alongside; the vessel (in the act of\n      cutting-in) hove over to the monster as if to a quay; and a boat,\n      hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity, is about giving chase\n      to whales in the distance. The harpoons and lances lie levelled for use;\n      three oarsmen are just setting the mast in its hole; while from a sudden\n      roll of the sea, the little craft stands half-erect out of the water, like\n      a rearing horse.

Now it needs a strong, nervous arm to\n      strike the first iron into the fish; for often, in what is called a long\n      dart, the heavy implement has to be flung to the distance of twenty or\n      thirty feet. But however prolonged and exhausting the chase, the\n      harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost; indeed,\n      he is expected to set an example of superhuman activity to the rest, not\n      only by incredible rowing, but by repeated loud and intrepid exclamations;\n      and what it is to keep shouting at the top of one’s compass, while all the\n      other muscles are strained and half started—what that is none know\n      but those who have tried it. For one, I cannot bawl very heartily and work\n      very recklessly at one and the same time. In this straining, bawling\n      state, then, with his back to the fish, all at once the exhausted\n      harpooneer hears the exciting cry—“Stand up, and give it to him!” He\n      now has to drop and secure his oar, turn round on his centre half way,\n      seize his harpoon from the crotch, and with what little strength may\n      remain, he essays to pitch it somehow into the whale. No wonder, taking\n      the whole fleet of whalemen in a body, that out of fifty fair chances for\n      a dart, not five are successful; no wonder that so many hapless\n      harpooneers are madly cursed and disrated; no wonder that some of them\n      actually burst their blood-vessels in the boat; no wonder that some sperm\n      whalemen are absent four years with four barrels; no wonder that to many\n      ship owners, whaling is but a losing concern; for it is the harpooneer\n      that makes the voyage, and if you take the breath out of his body how can\n      you expect to find it there when most wanted!"

Thereby\n      the weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler, who snatches it up as\n      readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his rifle from the wall.

It is a doubling of\n      the chances. But it very often happens that owing to the instantaneous,\n      violent, convulsive running of the whale upon receiving the first iron, it\n      becomes impossible for the harpooneer, however lightning-like in his\n      movements, to pitch the second iron into him. Nevertheless, as the second\n      iron is already connected with the line, and the line is running, hence\n      that weapon must, at all events, be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat,\n      somehow and somewhere; else the most terrible jeopardy would involve all\n      hands. Tumbled into the water, it accordingly is in such cases; the spare\n      coils of box line (mentioned in a preceding chapter) making this feat, in\n      most instances, prudently practicable.

And now suspended in stages over the side, Starbuck and Stubb,\n      the mates, armed with their long spades, began cutting a hole in the body\n      for the insertion of the hook just above the nearest of the two side-fins.\n      This done, a broad, semicircular line is cut round the hole, the hook is\n      inserted, and the main body of the crew striking up a wild chorus, now\n      commence heaving in one dense crowd at the windlass. When instantly, the\n      entire ship careens over on her side; every bolt in her starts like the\n      nail-heads of an old house in frosty weather; she trembles, quivers, and\n      nods her frighted mast-heads to the sky. More and more she leans over to\n      the whale, while every gasping heave of the windlass is answered by a\n      helping heave from the billows; till at last, a swift, startling snap is\n      heard; with a great swash the ship rolls upwards and backwards from the\n      whale, and the triumphant tackle rises into sight dragging after it the\n      disengaged semicircular end of the first strip of blubber. Now as the\n      blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an orange, so is it\n      stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is sometimes stripped by\n      spiralizing it.

But these\n      marks do not seem to be impressed upon the isinglass substance above\n      mentioned, but seem to be seen through it, as if they were engraved upon\n      the body itself. Nor is this all. In some instances, to the quick,\n      observant eye, those linear marks, as in a veritable engraving, but afford\n      the ground for far other delineations. These are hieroglyphical; that is,\n      if you call those mysterious cyphers on the walls of pyramids\n      hieroglyphics, then that is the proper word to use in the present\n      connexion. By my retentive memory of the hieroglyphics upon one Sperm\n      Whale in particular, I was much struck with a plate representing the old\n      Indian characters chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades on the\n      banks of the Upper Mississippi. Like those mystic rocks, too, the\n      mystic-marked whale remains undecipherable. This allusion to the Indian\n      rocks reminds me of another thing. Besides all the other phenomena which\n      the exterior of the Sperm Whale presents, he not seldom displays the back,\n      and more especially his flanks, effaced in great part of the regular\n      linear appearance, by reason of numerous rude scratches, altogether of an\n      irregular, random aspect. I should say that those New England rocks on the\n      sea-coast, which Agassiz imagines to bear the marks of violent scraping\n      contact with vast floating icebergs—I should say, that those rocks\n      must not a little resemble the Sperm Whale in this particular. It also\n      seems to me that such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile\n      contact with other whales; for I have most remarked them in the large,\n      full-grown bulls of the species."

It has already been said, that it is stript from him in long\n      pieces, called blanket-pieces. Like most sea-terms, this one is very happy\n      and significant. For the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber as in a\n      real blanket or counterpane; or, still better, an Indian poncho slipt over\n      his head, and skirting his extremity. It is by reason of this cosy\n      blanketing of his body, that the whale is enabled to keep himself\n      comfortable in all weathers, in all seas, times, and tides. What would\n      become of a Greenland whale, say, in those shuddering, icy seas of the\n      North, if unsupplied with his cosy surtout? True, other fish are found\n      exceedingly brisk in those Hyperborean waters; but these, be it observed,\n      are your cold-blooded, lungless fish, whose very bellies are\n      refrigerators; creatures, that warm themselves under the lee of an\n      iceberg, as a traveller in winter would bask before an inn fire; whereas,\n      like man, the whale has lungs and warm blood. Freeze his blood, and he\n      dies. How wonderful is it then—except after explanation—that\n      this great monster, to whom corporeal warmth is as indispensable as it is\n      to man; how wonderful that he should be found at home, immersed to his\n      lips for life in those Arctic waters! where, when seamen fall overboard,\n      they are sometimes found, months afterwards, perpendicularly frozen into\n      the hearts of fields of ice, as a fly is found glued in amber. But more\n      surprising is it to know, as has been proved by experiment, that the blood\n      of a Polar whale is warmer than that of a Borneo negro in summer."

A strange, apostolic whim having\n      seized him, he had left Neskyeuna for Nantucket, where, with that cunning\n      peculiar to craziness, he assumed a steady, common-sense exterior, and\n      offered himself as a green-hand candidate for the Jeroboam’s whaling\n      voyage. They engaged him; but straightway upon the ship’s getting out of\n      sight of land, his insanity broke out in a freshet. He announced himself\n      as the archangel Gabriel, and commanded the captain to jump overboard. He\n      published his manifesto, whereby he set himself forth as the deliverer of\n      the isles of the sea and vicar-general of all Oceanica. The unflinching\n      earnestness with which he declared these things;—the dark, daring\n      play of his sleepless, excited imagination, and all the preternatural\n      terrors of real delirium, united to invest this Gabriel in the minds of\n      the majority of the ignorant crew, with an atmosphere of sacredness.\n      Moreover, they were afraid of him. As such a man, however, was not of much\n      practical use in the ship, especially as he refused to work except when he\n      pleased, the incredulous captain would fain have been rid of him; but\n      apprised that that individual’s intention was to land him in the first\n      convenient port, the archangel forthwith opened all his seals and vials—devoting\n      the ship and all hands to unconditional perdition, in case this intention\n      was carried out. So strongly did he work upon his disciples among the\n      crew, that at last in a body they went to the captain and told him if\n      Gabriel was sent from the ship, not a man of them would remain. He was\n      therefore forced to relinquish his plan. Nor would they permit Gabriel to\n      be any way maltreated, say or do what he would; so that it came to pass\n      that Gabriel had the complete freedom of the ship. The consequence of all\n      this was, that the archangel cared little or nothing for the captain and\n      mates; and since the epidemic had broken out, he carried a higher hand\n      than ever; declaring that the plague, as he called it, was at his sole\n      command; nor should it be stayed but according to his good pleasure. The\n      sailors, mostly poor devils, cringed, and some of them fawned before him;\n      in obedience to his instructions, sometimes rendering him personal homage,\n      as to a god. Such things may seem incredible; but, however wondrous, they\n      are true. Nor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respect to\n      the measureless self-deception of the fanatic himself, as his measureless\n      power of deceiving and bedevilling so many others.

Now hands are\n      wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there. There is no staying in\n      any one place; for at one and the same time everything has to be done\n      everywhere. It is much the same with him who endeavors the description of\n      the scene. We must now retrace our way a little. It was mentioned that\n      upon first breaking ground in the whale’s back, the blubber-hook was\n      inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the mates. But\n      how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that\n      hole? It was inserted there by my particular friend Queequeg, whose duty\n      it was, as harpooneer, to descend upon the monster’s back for the special\n      purpose referred to. But in very many cases, circumstances require that\n      the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole flensing or\n      stripping operation is concluded. The whale, be it observed, lies almost\n      entirely submerged, excepting the immediate parts operated upon. So down\n      there, some ten feet below the level of the deck, the poor harpooneer\n      flounders about, half on the whale and half in the water, as the vast mass\n      revolves like a tread-mill beneath him. On the occasion in question,\n      Queequeg figured in the Highland costume—a shirt and socks—in\n      which to my eyes, at least, he appeared to uncommon advantage; and no one\n      had a better chance to observe him, as will presently be seen."

You have seen Italian organ-boys holding a dancing-ape by a long\n      cord. Just so, from the ship’s steep side, did I hold Queequeg down there\n      in the sea, by what is technically called in the fishery a monkey-rope,\n      attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his waist."

So that for better or for worse, we two, for the time, were wedded;\n      and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more, then both usage and honor\n      demanded, that instead of cutting the cord, it should drag me down in his\n      wake.

How is it,\n      then, with the whale? True, both his eyes, in themselves, must\n      simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more comprehensive,\n      combining, and subtle than man’s, that he can at the same moment of time\n      attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on one side of him, and\n      the other in an exactly opposite direction?

Moreover you observe that the whale has no\n      external nose; and that what nose he has—his spout hole—is on\n      the top of his head; you observe that his eyes and ears are at the sides\n      of his head, nearly one third of his entire length from the front.\n      Wherefore, you must now have perceived that the front of the Sperm Whale’s\n      head is a dead, blind wall, without a single organ or tender prominence of\n      any sort whatsoever. Furthermore, you are now to consider that only in the\n      extreme, lower, backward sloping part of the front of the head, is there\n      the slightest vestige of bone; and not till you get near twenty feet from\n      the forehead do you come to the full cranial development. So that this\n      whole enormous boneless mass is as one wad. Finally, though, as will soon\n      be revealed, its contents partly comprise the most delicate oil; yet, you\n      are now to be apprised of the nature of the substance which so impregnably\n      invests all that apparent effeminacy. In some previous place I have\n      described to you how the blubber wraps the body of the whale, as the rind\n      wraps an orange. Just so with the head; but with this difference: about\n      the head this envelope, though not so thick, is of a boneless toughness,\n      inestimable by any man who has not handled it. The severest pointed\n      harpoon, the sharpest lance darted by the strongest human arm, impotently\n      rebounds from it. It is as though the forehead of the Sperm Whale were\n      paved with horses’ hoofs. I do not think that any sensation lurks in it."

It\n      is a German conceit, that the vertebræ are absolutely undeveloped skulls.\n      But the curious external resemblance, I take it the Germans were not the\n      first men to perceive. A foreign friend once pointed it out to me, in the\n      skeleton of a foe he had slain, and with the vertebræ of which he was\n      inlaying, in a sort of basso-relievo, the beaked prow of his canoe. Now, I\n      consider that the phrenologists have omitted an important thing in not\n      pushing their investigations from the cerebellum through the spinal canal.\n      For I believe that much of a man’s character will be found betokened in\n      his backbone.

As it\n      passes through the remaining vertebræ the canal tapers in size, but for a\n      considerable distance remains of large capacity. Now, of course, this\n      canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous substance—the\n      spinal cord—as the brain; and directly communicates with the brain.\n      And what is still more, for many feet after emerging from the brain’s\n      cavity, the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth, almost equal to\n      that of the brain.

Not so with the whale; one of whose peculiarities it\n      is to have an entire non-valvular structure of the blood-vessels, so that\n      when pierced even by so small a point as a harpoon, a deadly drain is at\n      once begun upon his whole arterial system; and when this is heightened by\n      the extraordinary pressure of water at a great distance below the surface,\n      his life may be said to pour from him in incessant streams. Yet so vast is\n      the quantity of blood in him, and so distant and numerous its interior\n      fountains, that he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable\n      period; even as in a drought a river will flow, whose source is in the\n      well-springs of far-off and undiscernible hills. Even now, when the boats\n      pulled upon this whale, and perilously drew over his swaying flukes, and\n      the lances were darted into him, they were followed by steady jets from\n      the new made wound, which kept continually playing, while the natural\n      spout-hole in his head was only at intervals, however rapid, sending its\n      affrighted moisture into the air. From this last vent no blood yet came,\n      because no vital part of him had thus far been struck. His life, as they\n      significantly call it, was untouched."

Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their gills,\n      the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times is combined\n      with the element in which they swim; hence, a herring or a cod might live\n      a century, and never once raise its head above the surface. But owing to\n      his marked internal structure which gives him regular lungs, like a human\n      being’s, the whale can only live by inhaling the disengaged air in the\n      open atmosphere. Wherefore the necessity for his periodical visits to the\n      upper world. But he cannot in any degree breathe through his mouth, for,\n      in his ordinary attitude, the Sperm Whale’s mouth is buried at least eight\n      feet beneath the surface; and what is still more, his windpipe has no\n      connexion with his mouth. No, he breathes through his spiracle alone; and\n      this is on the top of his head."

Assume it, and it\n      follows that if all the blood in a man could be aerated with one breath,\n      he might then seal up his nostrils and not fetch another for a\n      considerable time. That is to say, he would then live without breathing.\n      Anomalous as it may seem, this is precisely the case with the whale, who\n      systematically lives, by intervals, his full hour and more (when at the\n      bottom) without drawing a single breath, or so much as in any way inhaling\n      a particle of air; for, remember, he has no gills. How is this? Between\n      his ribs and on each side of his spine he is supplied with a remarkable\n      involved Cretan labyrinth of vermicelli-like vessels, which vessels, when\n      he quits the surface, are completely distended with oxygenated blood. So\n      that for an hour or more, a thousand fathoms in the sea, he carries a\n      surplus stock of vitality in him, just as the camel crossing the waterless\n      desert carries a surplus supply of drink for future use in its four\n      supplementary stomachs. The anatomical fact of this labyrinth is\n      indisputable; and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable and\n      true, seems the more cogent to me, when I consider the otherwise\n      inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in having his spoutings out, as\n      the fishermen phrase it. This is what I mean. If unmolested, upon rising\n      to the surface, the Sperm Whale will continue there for a period of time\n      exactly uniform with all his other unmolested risings. Say he stays eleven\n      minutes, and jets seventy times, that is, respires seventy breaths; then\n      whenever he rises again, he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over\n      again, to a minute. Now, if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him,\n      so that he sounds, he will be always dodging up again to make good his\n      regular allowance of air. And not till those seventy breaths are told,\n      will he finally go down to stay out his full term below. Remark, however,\n      that in different individuals these rates are different; but in any one\n      they are alike. Now, why should the whale thus insist upon having his\n      spoutings out, unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air, ere\n      descending for good? How obvious is it, too, that this necessity for the\n      whale’s rising exposes him to all the fatal hazards of the chase. For not\n      by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught, when sailing a\n      thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight. Not so much thy skill, then, O\n      hunter, as the great necessities that strike the victory to thee!"

But sperm whales are not every day\n      encountered; while you may, then, you must kill all you can.

Hence it is, that at times like these\n      the drugg, comes into requisition. Our boat was furnished with three of\n      them. The first and second were successfully darted, and we saw the whales\n      staggeringly running off, fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of\n      the towing drugg. They were cramped like malefactors with the chain and\n      ball. But upon flinging the third, in the act of tossing overboard the\n      clumsy wooden block, it caught under one of the seats of the boat, and in\n      an instant tore it out and carried it away, dropping the oarsman in the\n      boat’s bottom as the seat slid from under him.

For amber, though at times found on\n      the sea-coast, is also dug up in some far inland soils, whereas ambergris\n      is never found except upon the sea. Besides, amber is a hard, transparent,\n      brittle, odorless substance, used for mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and\n      ornaments; but ambergris is soft, waxy, and so highly fragrant and spicy,\n      that it is largely used in perfumery, in pastiles, precious candles,\n      hair-powders, and pomatum. The Turks use it in cooking, and also carry it\n      to Mecca, for the same purpose that frankincense is carried to St. Peter’s\n      in Rome.

Because\n      those whalemen did not then, and do not now, try out their oil at sea as\n      the Southern ships have always done; but cutting up the fresh blubber in\n      small bits, thrust it through the bung holes of large casks, and carry it\n      home in that manner; the shortness of the season in those Icy Seas, and\n      the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed, forbidding any\n      other course. The consequence is, that upon breaking into the hold, and\n      unloading one of these whale cemeteries, in the Greenland dock, a savor is\n      given forth somewhat similar to that arising from excavating an old city\n      grave-yard, for the foundations of a Lying-in Hospital."

As its name imports (smeer,\n      fat; berg, to put up), this village was founded in order to afford a place\n      for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to be tried out, without being\n      taken home to Holland for that purpose. It was a collection of furnaces,\n      fat-kettles, and oil sheds; and when the works were in full operation\n      certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor. But all this is quite\n      different with a South Sea Sperm Whaler; which in a voyage of four years\n      perhaps, after completely filling her hold with oil, does not, perhaps,\n      consume fifty days in the business of boiling out; and in the state that\n      it is casked, the oil is nearly scentless. The truth is, that living or\n      dead, if but decently treated, whales as a species are by no means\n      creatures of ill odor; nor can whalemen be recognised, as the people of\n      the middle ages affected to detect a Jew in the company, by the nose. Nor\n      indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant, when, as a\n      general thing, he enjoys such high health; taking abundance of exercise;\n      always out of doors; though, it is true, seldom in the open air. I say,\n      that the motion of a Sperm Whale’s flukes above water dispenses a perfume,\n      as when a musk-scented lady rustles her dress in a warm parlor. What then\n      shall I liken the Sperm Whale to for fragrance, considering his magnitude?\n      Must it not be to that famous elephant, with jewelled tusks, and redolent\n      with myrrh, which was led out of an Indian town to do honor to Alexander\n      the Great?"

With his gaff, the gaffman hooks on to a sheet\n      of blubber, and strives to hold it from slipping, as the ship pitches and\n      lurches about. Meanwhile, the spade-man stands on the sheet itself,\n      perpendicularly chopping it into the portable horse-pieces. This spade is\n      sharp as hone can make it; the spademan’s feet are shoeless; the thing he\n      stands on will sometimes irresistibly slide away from him, like a sledge.\n      If he cuts off one of his own toes, or one of his assistants’, would you\n      be very much astonished? Toes are scarce among veteran blubber-room men."

And though now nailed amidst all the\n      rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes, yet,\n      untouchable and immaculate to any foulness, it still preserved its Quito\n      glow. Nor, though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour passed by\n      ruthless hands, and through the livelong nights shrouded with thick\n      darkness which might cover any pilfering approach, nevertheless every\n      sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last. For it was set\n      apart and sanctified to one awe-striking end; and however wanton in their\n      sailor ways, one and all, the mariners revered it as the white whale’s\n      talisman. Sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night,\n      wondering whose it was to be at last, and whether he would ever live to\n      spend it."

Pity if there is nothing wonderful in signs, and significant\n      in wonders! There’s a clue somewhere; wait a bit; hist—hark! By\n      Jove, I have it! Look you, Doubloon, your zodiac here is the life of man\n      in one round chapter; and now I’ll read it off, straight out of the book.\n      Come, Almanack! To begin: there’s Aries, or the Ram—lecherous dog,\n      he begets us; then, Taurus, or the Bull—he bumps us the first thing;\n      then Gemini, or the Twins—that is, Virtue and Vice; we try to reach\n      Virtue, when lo! comes Cancer the Crab, and drags us back; and here, going\n      from Virtue, Leo, a roaring Lion, lies in the path—he gives a few\n      fierce bites and surly dabs with his paw; we escape, and hail Virgo, the\n      Virgin! that’s our first love; we marry and think to be happy for aye,\n      when pop comes Libra, or the Scales—happiness weighed and found\n      wanting; and while we are very sad about that, Lord! how we suddenly jump,\n      as Scorpio, or the Scorpion, stings us in the rear; we are curing the\n      wound, when whang come the arrows all round; Sagittarius, or the Archer,\n      is amusing himself. As we pluck out the shafts, stand aside! here’s the\n      battering-ram, Capricornus, or the Goat; full tilt, he comes rushing, and\n      headlong we are tossed; when Aquarius, or the Water-bearer, pours out his\n      whole deluge and drowns us; and to wind up with Pisces, or the Fishes, we\n      sleep. There’s a sermon now, writ in high heaven, and the sun goes through\n      it every year, and yet comes out of it all alive and hearty. Jollily he,\n      aloft there, wheels through toil and trouble; and so, alow here, does\n      jolly Stubb. Oh, jolly’s the word for aye! Adieu, Doubloon!

Yea, more than equally, thought\n      Ahab; since both the ancestry and posterity of Grief go further than the\n      ancestry and posterity of Joy. For, not to hint of this: that it is an\n      inference from certain canonic teachings, that while some natural\n      enjoyments here shall have no children born to them for the other world,\n      but, on the contrary, shall be followed by the joy-childlessness of all\n      hell’s despair; whereas, some guilty mortal miseries shall still fertilely\n      beget to themselves an eternally progressive progeny of griefs beyond the\n      grave; not at all to hint of this, there still seems an inequality in the\n      deeper analysis of the thing.

For nothing was this man\n      more remarkable, than for a certain impersonal stolidity as it were;\n      impersonal, I say; for it so shaded off into the surrounding infinite of\n      things, that it seemed one with the general stolidity discernible in the\n      whole visible world; which while pauselessly active in uncounted modes,\n      still eternally holds its peace, and ignores you, though you dig\n      foundations for cathedrals. Yet was this half-horrible stolidity in him,\n      involving, too, as it appeared, an all-ramifying heartlessness;—yet\n      was it oddly dashed at times, with an old, crutch-like, antediluvian,\n      wheezing humorousness, not unstreaked now and then with a certain grizzled\n      wittiness; such as might have served to pass the time during the midnight\n      watch on the bearded forecastle of Noah’s ark. Was it that this old\n      carpenter had been a life-long wanderer, whose much rolling, to and fro,\n      not only had gathered no moss; but what is more, had rubbed off whatever\n      small outward clingings might have originally pertained to him? He was a\n      stript abstract; an unfractioned integral; uncompromised as a new-born\n      babe; living without premeditated reference to this world or the next. You\n      might almost say, that this strange uncompromisedness in him involved a\n      sort of unintelligence; for in his numerous trades, he did not seem to\n      work so much by reason or by instinct, or simply because he had been\n      tutored to it, or by any intermixture of all these, even or uneven; but\n      merely by a kind of deaf and dumb, spontaneous literal process. He was a\n      pure manipulator; his brain, if he had ever had one, must have early oozed\n      along into the muscles of his fingers. He was like one of those\n      unreasoning but still highly useful, multum in parvo, Sheffield\n      contrivances, assuming the exterior—though a little swelled—of\n      a common pocket knife; but containing, not only blades of various sizes,\n      but also screw-drivers, cork-screws, tweezers, awls, pens, rulers,\n      nail-filers, countersinkers. So, if his superiors wanted to use the\n      carpenter for a screw-driver, all they had to do was to open that part of\n      him, and the screw was fast: or if for tweezers, take him up by the legs,\n      and there they were."

I make a leg for Captain Ahab, and he wears it like\n      a gentleman; but I make a bandbox for Queequeg, and he won’t put his head\n      into it. Are all my pains to go for nothing with that coffin? And now I’m\n      ordered to make a life-buoy of it. It’s like turning an old coat; going to\n      bring the flesh on the other side now. I don’t like this cobbling sort of\n      business—I don’t like it at all; it’s undignified; it’s not my\n      place. Let tinkers’ brats do tinkerings; we are their betters. I like to\n      take in hand none but clean, virgin, fair-and-square mathematical jobs,\n      something that regularly begins at the beginning, and is at the middle\n      when midway, and comes to an end at the conclusion; not a cobbler’s job,\n      that’s at an end in the middle, and at the beginning at the end. It’s the\n      old woman’s tricks to be giving cobbling jobs. Lord! what an affection all\n      old women have for tinkers. I know an old woman of sixty-five who ran away\n      with a bald-headed young tinker once. And that’s the reason I never would\n      work for lonely widow old women ashore, when I kept my job-shop in the\n      Vineyard; they might have taken it into their lonely old heads to run off\n      with me. But heigh-ho! there are no caps at sea but snow-caps. Let me see.\n      Nail down the lid; caulk the seams; pay over the same with pitch; batten\n      them down tight, and hang it with the snap-spring over the ship’s stern.\n      Were ever such things done before with a coffin? Some superstitious old\n      carpenters, now, would be tied up in the rigging, ere they would do the\n      job. But I’m made of knotty Aroostook hemlock; I don’t budge. Cruppered\n      with a coffin! Sailing about with a grave-yard tray! But never mind. We\n      workers in woods make bridal-bedsteads and card-tables, as well as coffins\n      and hearses. We work by the month, or by the job, or by the profit; not\n      for us to ask the why and wherefore of our work, unless it be too\n      confounded cobbling, and then we stash it if we can. Hem! I’ll do the job,\n      now, tenderly. I’ll have me—let’s see—how many in the ship’s\n      company, all told? But I’ve forgotten. Any way, I’ll have me thirty\n      separate, Turk’s-headed life-lines, each three feet long hanging all round\n      to the coffin. Then, if the hull go down, there’ll be thirty lively\n      fellows all fighting for one coffin, a sight not seen very often beneath\n      the sun! Come hammer, caulking-iron, pitch-pot, and marling-spike! Let’s\n      to it.”"

There was some apprehension, but no positive\n      alarm, as yet. The recall signals were placed in the rigging; darkness\n      came on; and forced to pick up her three far to windward boats—ere\n      going in quest of the fourth one in the precisely opposite direction—the\n      ship had not only been necessitated to leave that boat to its fate till\n      near midnight, but, for the time, to increase her distance from it.

For such is the\n      wonderful skill, prescience of experience, and invincible confidence\n      acquired by some great natural geniuses among the Nantucket commanders;\n      that from the simple observation of a whale when last descried, they will,\n      under certain given circumstances, pretty accurately foretell both the\n      direction in which he will continue to swim for a time, while out of\n      sight, as well as his probable rate of progression during that period.\n      And, in these cases, somewhat as a pilot, when about losing sight of a\n      coast, whose general trending he well knows, and which he desires shortly\n      to return to again, but at some further point; like as this pilot stands\n      by his compass, and takes the precise bearing of the cape at present\n      visible, in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote, unseen\n      headland, eventually to be visited: so does the fisherman, at his compass,\n      with the whale; for after being chased, and diligently marked, through\n      several hours of daylight, then, when night obscures the fish, the\n      creature’s future wake through the darkness is almost as established to\n      the sagacious mind of the hunter, as the pilot’s coast is to him. So that\n      to this hunter’s wondrous skill, the proverbial evanescence of a thing\n      writ in water, a wake, is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as\n      the steadfast land. And as the mighty iron Leviathan of the modern railway\n      is so familiarly known in its every pace, that, with watches in their\n      hands, men time his rate as doctors that of a baby’s pulse; and lightly\n      say of it, the up train or the down train will reach such or such a spot,\n      at such or such an hour; even so, almost, there are occasions when these\n      Nantucketers time that other Leviathan of the deep, according to the\n      observed humor of his speed; and say to themselves, so many hours hence\n      this whale will have gone two hundred miles, will have about reached this\n      or that degree of latitude or longitude. But to render this acuteness at\n      all successful in the end, the wind and the sea must be the whaleman’s\n      allies; for of what present avail to the becalmed or windbound mariner is\n      the skill that assures him he is exactly ninety-three leagues and a\n      quarter from his port? Inferable from these statements, are many\n      collateral subtile matters touching the chase of whales."

What a lovely day\n      again! were it a new-made world, and made for a summer-house to the\n      angels, and this morning the first of its throwing open to them, a fairer\n      day could not dawn upon that world. Here’s food for thought, had Ahab time\n      to think; but Ahab never thinks; he only feels, feels, feels; that’s\n      tingling enough for mortal man! to think’s audacity. God only has that\n      right and privilege. Thinking is, or ought to be, a coolness and a\n      calmness; and our poor hearts throb, and our poor brains beat too much for\n      that. And yet, I’ve sometimes thought my brain was very calm—frozen\n      calm, this old skull cracks so, like a glass in which the contents turned\n      to ice, and shiver it. And still this hair is growing now; this moment\n      growing, and heat must breed it; but no, it’s like that sort of common\n      grass that will grow anywhere, between the earthy clefts of Greenland ice\n      or in Vesuvius lava. How the wild winds blow it; they whip it about me as\n      the torn shreds of split sails lash the tossed ship they cling to. A vile\n      wind that has no doubt blown ere this through prison corridors and cells,\n      and wards of hospitals, and ventilated them, and now comes blowing hither\n      as innocent as fleeces. Out upon it!—it’s tainted. Were I the wind,\n      I’d blow no more on such a wicked, miserable world. I’d crawl somewhere to\n      a cave, and slink there. And yet, ’tis a noble and heroic thing, the wind!\n      who ever conquered it? In every fight it has the last and bitterest blow.\n      Run tilting at it, and you but run through it. Ha! a coward wind that\n      strikes stark naked men, but will not stand to receive a single blow. Even\n      Ahab is a braver thing—a nobler thing than that. Would now the wind\n      but had a body; but all the things that most exasperate and outrage mortal\n      man, all these things are bodiless, but only bodiless as objects, not as\n      agents. There’s a most special, a most cunning, oh, a most malicious\n      difference! And yet, I say again, and swear it now, that there’s something\n      all glorious and gracious in the wind. These warm Trade Winds, at least,\n      that in the clear heavens blow straight on, in strong and steadfast,\n      vigorous mildness; and veer not from their mark, however the baser\n      currents of the sea may turn and tack, and mightiest Mississippies of the\n      land swift and swerve about, uncertain where to go at last. And by the\n      eternal Poles! these same Trades that so directly blow my good ship on;\n      these Trades, or something like them—something so unchangeable, and\n      full as strong, blow my keeled soul along! To it! Aloft there! What d’ye\n      see?”"

Retribution, swift vengeance,\n      eternal malice were in his whole aspect, and spite of all that mortal man\n      could do, the solid white buttress of his forehead smote the ship’s\n      starboard bow, till men and timbers reeled.

So, floating\n      on the margin of the ensuing scene, and in full sight of it, when the\n      halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me, I was then, but slowly,\n      drawn towards the closing vortex. When I reached it, it had subsided to a\n      creamy pool. Round and round, then, and ever contracting towards the\n      button-like black bubble at the axis of that slowly wheeling circle, like\n      another Ixion I did revolve. Till, gaining that vital centre, the black\n      bubble upward burst; and now, liberated by reason of its cunning spring,\n      and, owing to its great buoyancy, rising with great force, the coffin\n      life-buoy shot lengthwise from the sea, fell over, and floated by my side.\n      Buoyed up by that coffin, for almost one whole day and night, I floated on\n      a soft and dirgelike main. The unharming sharks, they glided by as if with\n      padlocks on their mouths; the savage sea-hawks sailed with sheathed beaks.\n      On the second day, a sail drew near, nearer, and picked me up at last. It\n      was the devious-cruising Rachel, that in her retracing search after her\n      missing children, only found another orphan."
