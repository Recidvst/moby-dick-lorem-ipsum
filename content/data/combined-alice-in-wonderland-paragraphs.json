As to the bottles, they\n      each took a pair of plates, which they hastily fitted on as wings, and so,\n      with forks for legs, went fluttering about in all directions: ‘and very\n      like birds they look,’ Alice thought to herself, as well as she could in\n      the dreadful confusion that was beginning."
