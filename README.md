- Using Vue.js/Nuxt for the frontend and SQLite for the data source. It used to use a Node backend with MongoDB and GraphQL but I recently simplified things.

- Text courtesy of [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2701)
- Thanks to [Hero Patterns](https://www.heropatterns.com/) for the awesome SVG backgrounds

Todo:
